# Intro

> "A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$, if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$."

## Types of machine learning

- Supervised learning: labeled examples of correct behaviour
  - e.g. image recognition
- Reinforcement learning: learning system interacts with the world, learns to maximize scalar reward signal
  - e.g. playing pong
- Unsupervised learning: no labeled examples, system looks for interesting patters in the data
  - e.g. 

## Frameworks

- PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX
- Useful features like
  - autodiff
  - computation graphs
  - libraries of algorithms and primitives
  - GPU support
